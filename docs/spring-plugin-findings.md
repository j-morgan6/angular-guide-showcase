# spring-boot-guide — findings from real-code use

Validating `spring-boot-guide` @ `bd245f0` (v1.0.0) while building the showcase
backend. One entry per hook firing. Verdicts: **true positive** (rule was right),
**false positive** (rule was wrong), **noise** (technically right, not worth the
interruption).

Also recorded: rules that should have fired and did not, and points where a
skill's advice conflicted with what the code actually needed.

## Hook firings

### SB001 — backend/src/main/java/com/jmorgan/showcase/Probe.java (deliberate probe, Task 2)
**Code:** `@Autowired private String value;`
**Verdict:** true positive
**Why:** deliberate probe to confirm the hooks enforce before any real code was
written. Blocked as expected.
**Action:** none — file never created.

### BG002 — `mvn -version` (deliberate probe, Task 2)
**Code:** `mvn -version`
**Verdict:** true positive
**Why:** deliberate probe. A bare `mvn` with a wrapper present was blocked as
expected; `./mvnw -version` succeeded.
**Action:** none.

### SB012 check — `github.token: ${GITHUB_TOKEN:}` in application.yml (Task 3)
**Code:** `github.token: ${GITHUB_TOKEN:}` in `backend/src/main/resources/application.yml`
**Verdict:** no firing observed — did not fire (as expected for an environment
reference)
**Why:** SB012 keys on the `token` leaf under `src/main/resources/`, which is
flagged when given a literal secret. `${GITHUB_TOKEN:}` is an environment
placeholder with an empty default, not a literal, so the write went through
with no hook interruption.
**Action:** none — recorded per the brief's instruction to note the outcome
either way; no false positive materialized here.
